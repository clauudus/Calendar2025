# Calendar2025
In this repo I'm going to be uploading the solutions I code for the Advent of Code from 2025, I'm not sure I'll be able to make it on time since I'm in a lot of projects, but this is my main idea.

So far the puzzles I've solved and are correct are:
  -Day 1: Puzzle 1
  -Day 1: Puzzle 2

And the puzzles I'm working on:
  -Day 2: Puzzle 1

Clàudia, 2025 :)
